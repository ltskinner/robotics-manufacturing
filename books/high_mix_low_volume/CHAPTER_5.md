## 5.1 Change Paradigms

Framework for change:

- 1. Continuous Improvement

- 3. Reengineering
- 4. Reinventing

Intangibles with change:

- Integrity
- Passion

## 5.2 Education

## 5.3 Relevance

## 5.4 Metrics

## 5.5 Inventory Turnover

Total inventory investment is calculated based on standard cost. The total inventory investment will include all of the following types of inventories and this list may not be exhaustive

- Raw material
- Work in process
- Finished goods
- Pipeline (in-transit)
- Defective
- Repair material
- Obsolete material
- Consigned material
- Scrap

## 5.6 Productivity

Productivity is defined and expressed as the ratio of salable output produced (i.e. throughput) to input resources consumed by a given organizational unit. Productivity measurement provides insight into how effectively a mfct is utilizing its constraint and bottleneck resources

## 5.7 Operations Performance

## 5.8 World Class

World-class manufacturers create systems and processes that facilitate superior levels of flow in both information and products. Such organizations are characterized by management teams that have coherence of vision, consistency of implementation, strength of leadership, and a healthy fear of orgnaizational complacency. World-class manufacturers exhibit the following four characteristics:

- The preferred supplier of products, information, and services in world markets
- The preferred choice of capital investment in world financial markets
- The primary choice of employment
- The preferred business choice of the community

World-class manufacturers have established cultures where continuous learning, continuous improvement, and reinventing through experimentation are a way of life. Detailed nonfinancial performance measurements are used to chart their progress toward achieving competitive advantage in key success factors such as cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, responsiveness, service and technology. The following examples of world-class performance measures are expressed as percentages, and this list is not exhaustive:

- 1. Reduction in setup time
- 2. Reduction in lot size
- 3. Reduction in cycle time
- 4. Reduction in floor space
- 5. Reduction in engineering changes
- 6. Reduction in warranty cost
- 7. Reduction in total cost of quality
- 8. Increase in on-time delivery
- 9. Increase in output per employee
- 10. Increase in inventory turnover
- 11. Increase in revenue based on new products
- 12. Increase in common parts per product
- 13. Increaes in internal customer satisfaction levels (survey)
- 14. Increase in external customer satisfaction levels (survey)
