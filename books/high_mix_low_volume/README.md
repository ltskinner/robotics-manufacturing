HMLV ranges:

- 600 products or greater
- 0-1,000 order quantities

Flexibiliy is defined as the capability or responsiveness to change

There are three intrinsic types of flexibliity:

- 1. Mix flexibility
- 2. Volume flexibility
- 3. Work force flexibility

## [Chapter 4 - Multiple Constraint synchronization (MCS)](CHAPTER_4.md)

World-class setup time is often associated with the JIT concept of "single minute exchange of die" (SMED) - defined as setupp time that is less than 10 minutes (aka single digit)

Sequence-independent single-minute setup times (SMED) should be a goal for any high-mix, low volume manufacturer that produces discrete products
