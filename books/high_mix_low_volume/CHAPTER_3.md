## 3.1 Customer Order Dimensions

## 3.2 Lot Sizing Simulation

## 3.3 Inventory

## 3.4 Responsiveness

for HMLV, schedules must not be developed based on local machine setup time avoidance criteria.

significant reductions in setup time can be achieved by simply performing as much setup preparation as possible while the machine is running (aka external setup) as opposed to performing these tasks while the machine is idke (aka internal setup)

rather than relying on engineering staff exclusively to reduce setup times, machine operators should be included in a setup time reduction project. by involving employees and using their knowledge, results and benefits will be achieved sooner

## 3.5 Balancing Capacity

## 3.6 Flexibility

For HMLV, essential to understand:

- relevant dimensions of flexibility
- extent to which flexibility enables mfct to competitively produce a variety of high quality, low cost products

Flexibiliy is defined as the capability or responsiveness to change

There are three intrinsic types of flexibliity:

- 1. Mix flexibility
- 2. Volume flexibility
- 3. Work force flexibility

Mix flexibility: is the result of being able to build different types of products using the same production resources. the ability of the production line to absorb dynamic changes in product mix is a function of process design and is often referred to as `process flexibility`. Flexible processes are characterized by its automation that has low sequence-independent setup cost per unit and manual processes that are prekitted (ie.e. inventory is pre-staged into assembly kits)

Volume flexibility is of importance in the context of process configuration. The benefits of volume flexibility are measured in terms of capacity utilization

## 3.7 Complexity

Complexity is most often associated with the design-related issues of a product that is composed of interconnected parts that involve some degree of intericacy to manufacture. Complexity is related to the number of discontinuities associated with a product that, in turn, directly affects the ability to produce the product. Compelxity also has a direct effect on the operating reliability of a product.

See complexity factor definition equation:

- Np total number of parts
- Nt total number of unique types of parts
- Ni total number of interconnections and interfaces
- f totan number of functions the product is expected to perform
- K constant of convenience

Design for Manufacturability and Assembly (DFMA)

Benefits:

- reduced time to market
- improved quality
- reduced cost
- increased reliability
- reduced redesigns
- reduced engineering change-orders
- increased automated assembly
