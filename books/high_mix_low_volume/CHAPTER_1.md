# Chapter 1 - High-Mix Manufacturing Competitive Strategy

## 1.1 Building a Competitive Advantage

- general idea is dont do the same thing as your competitors
- derive advantages though methods and measures the competitor will have difficulty following
  - after this has been achieved, extend the superiority as far as possible

Take 2 key players into account:

- the company
- the customer
- the competitor

Reps from each function must contribute to planning

## 1.2 Strategic Degrees of Freedom

- just because you can do anything doesnt mean your should
- main objective is to prevent wase of time and money on bad directions

Do SWOT analyses:

- The **S**trengths of the company relative to its customers and competitors
- The **W**eaknesses of the company relative to its customers and competitors
- Creation of new marketplace **O**pportunities through market segmentation or fragmentation

"Creatvity, innovation, and risk taking are necessary to facilitate learning the learning necessary to secure a competitive advantage. Success must be summoned. Success will not come unplanned."

## 1.3 Evolution to High-Mix Manufacturing

Focus on "time based" manufacturing - manage time not money

Create a system in which value-added time as a portion of total time is maximized through the entire value delivery chain

## 1.4 Strategic Cost Drivers

in good and bad times - these are fundamental competitive differentiators:

- low-cost variety
- quick response times

Increased variety increases costs due to complexity - variety costs include:

- inventory
- material handling
- setup
- test
- overhead costs

"the costs of complexity must be lower than the competition"

- the increases in mix-related costs grow at a faster rate than the cost savings achieved through economies of scale
- given constant or increasing variety of products, the competitor who reduces the costs associated with complexity will always outperform the competitor who focuses on volume

## 1.5 Agile Manufacturing

"Products are now information and services loaded"

## 1.6 Historical Heuristics

- need to perform a "directed search"
  - trial and error is expensive and inefficient
  - analytics methods are impractical
  - learn from the past

## 1.7 The Competitiveness Sigmoid Curve

Uhh generally speaking want to get inside competitions ooda loop
