# Chapter 4 - Multiple Constraint synchronization (MCS)

## 4.1 Strategic Capacity Planning

Three basic capacity strategies from which a mfct can choose:

- 1. Lead:
  - A proactice capacity strategy where capacity is increased based on *anticipated* increase in demand
  - potentially high risk, financial burden if demand does not increase is high
  - advantage is improved delivery performance due to tolerance for work disruptions
- 2. Lag:
  - A reactive strategy where capacity is increased based on a *demonstrated* increase in demand
  - cost based and does not carry excess capacity
  - risk of poor delivery performance
- 3. Tracking:
  - A proactice or reactive strategy where capacity is increased or decreased based on an anticipated or demonstrated increase or decrease in demand. Incremental increases in capacity are relatively small compared to the lead and lag capacity strategies

## 4.2 Modeling Operations

## 4.3 MCS Planning

World-class setup time is often associated with the JIT concept of "single minute exchange of die" (SMED) - defined as setupp time that is less than 10 minutes (aka single digit)

Sequence-independent single-minute setup times (SMED) should be a goal for any high-mix, low volume manufacturer that produces discrete products

## 4.4 MCS Lot Sequencing

## 4.5 Transfer Lot Sizing

WIP inventory is inherent to any multistage, serial flow, high-mix, low-volume mfct operation. WIP and production lead times are proportionate to the production lot size

## 4.6 Buffer Inventory

The primary objective of buffer inventories in a multi-stage, serial flow, hHMLV env is to increase the capacity and flexibility of the production system. Buffer inventories are used to address problems associated with disruptions such as processing time variability, machine breakdowns, machine preventative maintenance, repair, unplaned absenteeism, etc
