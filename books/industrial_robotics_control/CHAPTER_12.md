# Chapter 12 - Simulation

Digital twin useful for: mechanical and electrical sizing during the design phase; rough pre-tuning during the commisisoning phase; offline programming, remote monitoring, and control during application phase. "All robot mfgs develop and distribute digital twins for their robots"

Unity3D is pog (but this is also from 2023)

## Machine Learning

- imitation learning
  - learn by example. limitation is it cannot solve problems outside the scope of what was solved
- reinforcement learning
